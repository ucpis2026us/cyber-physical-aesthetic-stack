# CPAS Core Principles

The following principles define the foundational rules of the Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS).

All CPAS-compliant systems SHALL adhere to these principles.  
They are normative and override stylistic, branding, or experiential considerations.

---

## 1. Infrastructure Over Personality

Autonomous systems SHALL present themselves as infrastructure.

They SHALL NOT present themselves as characters, companions, assistants, or social entities.

Any implication of personality, identity, or agency beyond mechanical operation is non-compliant.

---

## 2. Calm Over Excitement

CPAS-compliant systems SHALL appear calm, stable, and controlled.

They SHALL NOT seek attention, provoke curiosity, or generate excitement through appearance, motion, or signaling.

Boredom is an intended and correct outcome.

---

## 3. Status Over Decoration

All visual elements SHALL communicate operational truth or not exist.

Decorative elements that do not convey state, constraint, or function are prohibited.

Color, light, motion, and sound exist only to signal system state.

---

## 4. Legibility Over Comfort

CPAS prioritizes clarity of interpretation over emotional comfort.

Systems SHALL be immediately understandable rather than friendly or reassuring.

Trust is earned through legibility, not familiarity.

---

## 5. Constraint Over Expression

Form SHALL communicate limitation, constraint, and capability boundaries.

Expressive geometry, organic styling, or emotive motion that suggests intent or awareness is prohibited.

Engineering constraint SHALL be visually apparent.

---

## 6. Absence as Signal

The absence of human-centric cues SHALL be treated as an intentional signal.

Human de-centering is a feature, not a defect.

Systems SHALL not acknowledge, track, or visually respond to human presence unless required for safety.

---

## 7. Silence as the Default State

Normal operation SHALL be silent.

Sound SHALL be used only for safety-critical signaling that requires immediate attention.

Any sound that creates personality, reassurance, or interaction is prohibited.

---

## 8. Interpretation Is a Safety Boundary

Human interpretation SHALL be treated as part of the system boundary.

If a system’s presentation causes misinterpretation, that constitutes a failure regardless of technical correctness.

Designs that rely on explanation to correct perception are non-compliant.

---

## 9. Time Resistance

CPAS-compliant systems SHALL resist aesthetic trends and speculative futurism.

Presentation SHALL remain valid and legible across decades.

If a system appears dated due to aesthetic fashion, CPAS has been violated.

---

## 10. Non-Anthropomorphism Is Mandatory

No CPAS-compliant system SHALL imply:
- consciousness
- intention
- emotion
- belief
- awareness
- moral agency

Anthropomorphic cues are prohibited regardless of intent.

---

## Summary

CPAS principles enforce a single outcome:

> Autonomous systems are perceived as systems, not as life.

Any design choice that undermines this outcome is non-compliant.
