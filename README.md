# Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS)

The **Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS)** is a design doctrine governing the visual, spatial, and perceptual presentation of autonomous cyber-physical systems.

CPAS exists to ensure that autonomous systems are interpreted by humans as **infrastructure**, not as agents, beings, or forms of life. It prevents anthropomorphism, reduces perceptual ambiguity, and lowers safety and operational risk caused by misinterpretation.

CPAS treats aesthetics as an **operational safety layer**, not as branding or stylistic expression.

---

## Purpose

As autonomous systems become more capable and widespread, failures increasingly arise not from computation, but from **human misinterpretation**.

Systems that appear expressive, conversational, or life-like cause humans to:
- overtrust outputs
- misassign responsibility
- experience fear or moral confusion
- misunderstand system limits and failure modes

CPAS addresses this problem by enforcing **perceptual unambiguousness**: autonomous systems must clearly present themselves as systems, not as minds.

---

## Canonical Principle

> **Autonomous systems must communicate truth through calm, legible physicality rather than personality, spectacle, or human resemblance.**

This principle is normative.

---

## Scope

CPAS governs:
- Visual appearance
- Color semantics
- Spatial and architectural presentation
- Human interaction zones
- Perceptual signaling (including sound)
- Interpretation at first glance and over time

CPAS does **not** govern:
- Internal algorithms
- Intelligence methods
- Decision logic
- Ethics frameworks
- Branding or marketing outside operational environments

---

## Status

- **Specification:** CPAS v1.0  
- **Document Type:** Normative design doctrine  
- **Authority Level:** Foundational  
- **Intended Use:** Industrial, infrastructural, autonomous systems  

CPAS v1.0 establishes a conservative, safety-oriented baseline intended to resist aesthetic drift.

---

## Relationship to UCPIS

CPAS is a companion doctrine to the **Universal Cyber-Physical Interoperability Stack (UCPIS)**.

- **UCPIS** defines *how* cyber-physical systems interoperate.
- **CPAS** defines *how those systems must be perceived by humans*.

Together, they address both technical and perceptual failure modes.

---

## Adoption

CPAS is open for adoption and implementation.

Any system may claim CPAS compliance **only if** it satisfies the requirements defined in this repository, including prohibitions and perceptual specifications.

Forks or modified versions must be renamed to preserve semantic integrity.
