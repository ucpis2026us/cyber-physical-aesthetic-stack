# Visual Expectations (CPAS)

This appendix defines what a human observer SHOULD expect to see when encountering a CPAS-compliant autonomous cyber-physical system.

These expectations are normative.  
If a system consistently violates them, it is non-compliant.

---

## 1. First-Glance Expectation (0–5 Seconds)

Upon first exposure, the observer SHOULD perceive:

- an environment or facility, not an object
- infrastructure, not a character
- coordination, not intention
- constraint, not expression

The system SHOULD immediately read as *already operating*, regardless of observation.

If the observer feels noticed, addressed, or acknowledged, CPAS has been violated.

---

## 2. Visual Hierarchy

A CPAS-compliant environment SHOULD visually resolve in the following order:

1. **Structure**
   - walls, frames, rails, enclosures
   - static, neutral, load-bearing elements

2. **Systems**
   - machines, robots, conveyors, platforms
   - repetitive, modular, constrained forms

3. **Signals**
   - lights, indicators, panels
   - small, localized, semantically meaningful

Signals SHALL NOT dominate structure.  
Structure SHALL dominate perception.

## 3. Color Expectation

The observer SHOULD expect:

- mostly neutral surfaces
- minimal color presence
- color only where information is emitted

Color SHOULD feel:
- deliberate
- sparse
- informative

If color appears decorative, immersive, or atmospheric, CPAS has been violated.

---

## 4. Motion Expectation

Motion SHOULD be:

- purposeful
- mechanically constrained
- directly tied to work being performed

The observer SHOULD NOT expect:
- idle animation
- expressive movement
- attention-seeking behavior

When nothing is happening, nothing SHOULD move.

---

## 5. Human Presence Expectation

If humans are visible, they SHOULD appear as:

- observers
- maintainers
- inspectors
- peripheral actors

Humans SHOULD NOT appear as:
- heroes
- operators-in-control
- central figures
- narrative focus

The system SHOULD appear capable of operating normally without human presence.

---

## 6. Sound Expectation

The observer SHOULD expect silence.

Sound SHOULD be rare and meaningful.

If sound is present during nominal operation, CPAS has been violated.

---

## 7. Emotional Expectation

The correct emotional response is:

- neutrality
- mild attentiveness
- situational awareness

The observer SHOULD NOT feel:
- comforted
- reassured
- intimidated
- impressed
- emotionally engaged

If the system evokes emotion beyond awareness, CPAS has failed.

---

## 8. Sustained Observation Expectation (≈ 60 Seconds)

After sustained observation, the observer SHOULD experience:

- reduced attention
- loss of novelty
- absence of curiosity about intent or thought

This outcome is correct.

If the observer remains engaged due to perceived intelligence or personality, CPAS has been violated.

---

## 9. Explanation-Free Interpretation

A CPAS-compliant system SHOULD be correctly interpreted without:

- signage explaining behavior
- staff interpretation
- documentation
- training materials

If explanation is required to correct perception, the system is non-compliant.

---

## Summary

A CPAS-compliant system looks:

- boring
- calm
- constrained
- indifferent
- infrastructural

These are not aesthetic failures.  
They are safety features.
