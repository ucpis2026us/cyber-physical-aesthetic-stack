# CPAS Appendices

This directory contains **normative and explanatory supporting material** for the Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS).

The appendices exist to:
- clarify interpretation
- document perceptual expectations
- define visual boundaries
- provide enforceable visual references
- support correct application of CPAS in real environments

Appendices are part of the CPAS v1.0 specification.

---

## Structure

The appendices are organized as follows:

```text
APPENDICES/
├── VISUAL_EXPECTATIONS.md
├── VISUAL_HAZARDS.md
└── IMAGES/
    ├── NORMATIVE/
    └── EXAMPLES/
```


Each component serves a distinct role.

## Textual Appendices

### `VISUAL_EXPECTATIONS.md`

Defines what a human observer SHOULD perceive when encountering a CPAS-compliant system.

This document focuses on:
- first-glance interpretation
- sustained observation
- emotional neutrality
- boredom as a safety signal

---

### `VISUAL_HAZARDS.md`

Defines visual configurations that are explicitly **non-compliant**.

This document:
- documents perceptual failure modes
- explains why certain designs are dangerous
- supports enforcement and audit decisions

Any configuration substantially similar to documented hazards is non-compliant.

---

## Visual Appendices

### `IMAGES/NORMATIVE/`

Contains **normative visual references**.

Images in this directory:
- define acceptable and unacceptable configurations
- carry authoritative weight
- are part of CPAS v1.0
- SHALL be used when determining compliance

These images are law-defining.

---

### `IMAGES/EXAMPLES/`

Contains **explanatory, non-normative images**.

Images in this directory:
- illustrate application contexts
- support education and onboarding
- demonstrate how rules may combine in practice

They SHALL NOT be used to determine compliance.

In the event of conflict, normative text and normative images SHALL prevail.

---

## Interpretation Order

When interpreting CPAS, the following precedence applies:

1. CPAS core documents
2. CPAS appendices (text)
3. CPAS normative images
4. CPAS explanatory images

No appendix may override CPAS core doctrine.

---

## Version

These appendices correspond to:

- **Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS) v1.0**

Future updates to appendices MUST preserve semantic consistency unless accompanied by an explicit version change.
