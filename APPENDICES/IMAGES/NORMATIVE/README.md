# Normative Visual References (CPAS)

This directory contains the **normative visual references** for the Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS).

Images in this directory are **authoritative**.  
They define acceptable and unacceptable visual configurations under CPAS v1.0.

Any system or environment that is substantially similar in appearance, structure, signaling, or perceptual effect to the configurations depicted here SHALL be interpreted as compliant or non-compliant accordingly.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of normative visual references is to:

- eliminate ambiguity in interpretation
- prevent semantic drift
- provide enforceable perceptual boundaries
- complement textual requirements where language alone is insufficient

These images are not illustrative or inspirational.  
They carry normative weight.

---

## Scope

Normative images define:

- color semantics and state transitions
- spatial zoning and permitted color regions
- signal priority and salience hierarchy
- correct vs hazardous visual configurations
- perceptual failure modes

They apply to:
- machines
- facilities
- rooms
- platforms
- autonomous entities
- cyber-physical environments

## Canonical Image Set (CPAS v1.0)

The following images constitute the CPAS v1.0 normative visual canon:

1. **State Color Transitions**  
   Temporal use of state colors across operational phases.

2. **Color Reference**  
   Permitted structural neutrals and state indicator colors.

3. **Spatial Zoning Diagram**  
   Allowed and prohibited locations for color usage.

4. **Signal Hierarchy Stack**  
   Priority ordering and salience requirements for signals.

5. **Visual Hazard Scenarios**  
   Non-compliant configurations that create perceptual risk.

No additional images SHALL be treated as normative unless explicitly declared in a future CPAS version.

---

## Relationship to Explanatory Images

Images located outside this directory, including those in `EXAMPLES/`, are **non-normative**.

They are provided for:
- education
- onboarding
- illustration
- implementation guidance

In the event of conflict between a normative image and an explanatory image, the normative image SHALL prevail.

---

## Version

These images are normative for:

- **Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS) v1.0**

Any future changes MUST be accompanied by a version increment and explicit declaration.

---

## Interpretation Rule

If correct interpretation requires explanation, the design is non-compliant.

Correct CPAS designs communicate truth at a glance.
