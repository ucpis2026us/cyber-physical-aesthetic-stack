# Explanatory Visual Examples (CPAS)

This directory contains **explanatory, non-normative visual examples** for the Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS).

Images in this directory are provided to:
- aid understanding
- illustrate application contexts
- support onboarding and education
- demonstrate how CPAS principles may appear in practice

They do **not** define compliance.

---

## Non-Normative Status

Images in this directory are **not authoritative**.

They SHALL NOT be used to:
- determine compliance
- override textual requirements
- contradict normative visual references
- redefine CPAS semantics

In the event of any conflict, the following SHALL take precedence:
1. CPAS normative text
2. CPAS normative images (`APPENDICES/IMAGES/NORMATIVE/`)
3. Explanatory examples (this directory)

---

## Purpose of Examples

These images exist to answer questions such as:
- “What might this look like in practice?”
- “How do the rules combine in a real environment?”
- “What is a common correct vs incorrect pattern?”

They are illustrative, not exhaustive.

Absence of an example does not imply prohibition.  
Presence of an example does not imply permission.

---

## Appropriate Use

Explanatory images MAY be used:
- in presentations
- in documentation
- in training materials
- for discussion and clarification

They MUST NOT be cited as normative authority.

---

## Design Variability

Examples may:
- reflect specific contexts
- include optional elements
- simplify or exaggerate certain aspects for clarity

These variations are intentional and do not alter CPAS requirements.

---

## Interpretation Rule

If an example appears to conflict with CPAS text or normative visuals, the example is incorrect by definition.

CPAS compliance is determined by doctrine, not illustration.

---

## Version

These examples correspond to:

- **Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS) v1.0**

They may be updated, replaced, or expanded without altering CPAS semantics.
