# CPAS Visual Assets

This directory contains the visual assets referenced by the Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS).

Visual assets are divided into **normative** and **explanatory** categories.  
The distinction is intentional and enforceable.

## Normative Images

The `NORMATIVE/` directory contains **authoritative visual references**.

Images in that directory:
- define acceptable and unacceptable configurations
- carry normative weight
- are part of CPAS v1.0
- SHALL be used when determining compliance

Normative images are equivalent in authority to CPAS normative text.

---

## Explanatory Images

The `EXAMPLES/` directory contains **non-normative visual examples**.

Images in that directory:
- illustrate application contexts
- support education and onboarding
- demonstrate how rules may combine in practice

They SHALL NOT be used to determine compliance.

---

## Interpretation Rule

In the event of conflict, the following precedence applies:

1. CPAS core documents
2. CPAS appendices (text)
3. CPAS normative images
4. CPAS explanatory images

Explanatory images SHALL NOT override normative material.
