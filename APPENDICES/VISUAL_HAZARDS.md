# Visual Hazards (CPAS)

This appendix documents visual configurations that constitute **perceptual hazards** under the Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS).

Visual hazards are patterns that cause humans to misinterpret autonomous cyber-physical systems as agents, beings, or entities with intent.

Any system exhibiting these hazards is **non-compliant**, regardless of technical correctness.

## 1. Definition of a Visual Hazard

A visual hazard exists when a system’s presentation causes a reasonable observer to:

- attribute awareness
- assign intention
- feel addressed or observed
- overtrust system judgment
- experience emotional response unrelated to safety

Visual hazards are failures of perception, not failures of engineering.

---

## 2. Anthropomorphic Cues (Hazard)

### Description
Visual elements that resemble faces, eyes, heads, or bodies.

### Examples
- paired lights resembling eyes
- central “head” units
- front-facing symmetry implying gaze
- moving elements that appear to look or orient toward humans

### Why Dangerous
Humans instinctively treat faces as social agents.

This leads to:
- misplaced trust
- hesitation in emergencies
- moral confusion about responsibility

Any facial resemblance is a CPAS violation.

## 3. Ambient or Decorative Color (Hazard)

### Description
Color used to create atmosphere rather than convey state.

### Examples
- colored architectural lighting
- glowing walls or floors
- mood lighting
- color used continuously without state change

### Why Dangerous
Ambient color trains humans to ignore color entirely, undermining safety signaling.

Color must be rare to remain truthful.

---

## 4. Priority Inversion (Hazard)

### Description
Lower-priority signals visually dominate higher-priority signals.

### Examples
- blue cyber-lighting brighter than red fault indicators
- decorative lighting overpowering warning lights
- complex dashboards obscuring critical alerts

### Why Dangerous
Humans attend to salience, not semantics.

Priority inversion causes delayed response to real danger.

---

## 5. Expressive Motion (Hazard)

### Description
Motion that implies curiosity, friendliness, or intent.

### Examples
- idle animation
- anticipatory movement
- gestural motion
- “watching” behavior

### Why Dangerous
Expressive motion suggests internal motivation and awareness.

This increases anthropomorphic attribution and emotional engagement.

---

## 6. Conversational or Voice Output (Hazard)

### Description
Any use of speech or conversational audio.

### Examples
- spoken alerts
- system narration
- verbal acknowledgments
- conversational prompts

### Why Dangerous
Language implies mind, intention, and social relationship.

It delays reaction and introduces interpretive ambiguity.

---

## 7. Narrative Framing (Hazard)

### Description
Presenting systems as characters within a story.

### Examples
- naming machines
- mascots or avatars
- backstories
- “meet the AI” displays

### Why Dangerous
Narrative framing encourages humans to empathize with systems.

Empathy toward machines undermines correct assignment of responsibility.

---

## 8. Human-Centered Hero Framing (Hazard)

### Description
Visuals that place humans as central actors controlling or partnering with the system.

### Examples
- heroic poses
- central framing of operators
- depictions implying continuous human oversight

### Why Dangerous
This misrepresents autonomy and creates false expectations of human intervention.

CPAS systems must appear capable without human presence.

---

## 9. Persistent Alerts Without Resolution (Hazard)

### Description
Alerts that remain active without escalation or resolution.

### Examples
- constant amber warnings
- repeating tones without change
- permanent alert states

### Why Dangerous
Humans adapt and begin to ignore signals.

This creates alarm fatigue and delayed response to real danger.

---

## 10. Emotional Atmosphere (Hazard)

### Description
Design elements intended to evoke comfort, excitement, fear, or awe.

### Examples
- dramatic lighting
- cinematic composition
- futuristic spectacle
- calming or intimidating audio

### Why Dangerous
Emotion interferes with judgment.

CPAS requires neutrality to preserve clarity.

---

## 11. Composite Hazard Environments

### Description
Multiple minor violations that combine into a dangerous whole.

### Examples
- mild ambient lighting + expressive motion
- subtle anthropomorphic geometry + conversational UI
- decorative color + human-centered framing

### Why Dangerous
Even small cues accumulate into strong anthropomorphic interpretation.

CPAS evaluates the *total perceptual effect*, not individual elements in isolation.

---

## 12. Normative Visual Reference

The following image defines common CPAS visual hazard scenarios:

- **Visual Hazard Scenarios (Non-Compliant)**

Any configuration substantially similar to those depicted SHALL be considered non-compliant.

---

## Summary

Visual hazards are conditions that cause humans to forget:

> “This is a system operating under constraint.”

If a system appears:
- alive
- expressive
- social
- emotionally engaging

then CPAS has been violated.

Correct systems do not demand attention.  
They allow attention to fade.
