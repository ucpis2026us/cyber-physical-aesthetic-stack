# CPAS Visual Hazards

This document defines **visual configurations that are non-compliant** under the Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS).

Visual hazards are perceptual failure modes that cause humans to misinterpret autonomous systems as agents, beings, or entities with intent.

Any system exhibiting these hazards is non-compliant, regardless of technical correctness.

## 1. Definition of a Visual Hazard

A visual hazard exists when a system’s presentation causes a reasonable observer to:

- attribute awareness
- assign intention
- feel addressed or observed
- overtrust system judgment
- experience emotional response unrelated to safety

Visual hazards are failures of perception, not engineering.

---

## 2. Anthropomorphic Cues

Hazardous elements include:
- face-like arrangements
- paired lights resembling eyes
- head-like symmetry
- gaze or tracking behavior

Why dangerous:
Humans instinctively treat faces as social agents, causing hesitation and misplaced trust.

Any facial resemblance is prohibited.

---

## 3. Ambient or Decorative Color

Hazardous patterns include:
- colored architectural lighting
- mood lighting
- glowing walls or floors
- persistent color without state meaning

Why dangerous:
Ambient color trains observers to ignore color entirely, undermining safety signals.

---

## 4. Priority Inversion

Hazardous patterns include:
- blue or decorative light overpowering red indicators
- dashboards obscuring critical alerts
- multiple signals competing visually

Why dangerous:
Humans attend to salience, not semantics.

Priority inversion delays response to danger.

## 5. Expressive Motion

Hazardous motion includes:
- idle animation
- gestural movement
- anticipatory behavior
- attention-seeking motion

Why dangerous:
Expressive motion implies internal intent or awareness.

---

## 6. Conversational or Voice Output

Hazardous elements include:
- spoken alerts
- narration
- conversational prompts
- verbal acknowledgment

Why dangerous:
Language implies mind and agency and delays reaction.

---

## 7. Narrative Framing

Hazardous framing includes:
- naming systems
- mascots or avatars
- storytelling displays
- “meet the AI” presentations

Why dangerous:
Narrative encourages empathy toward machines and misassigns responsibility.

---

## 8. Human-Centered Hero Framing

Hazardous depictions include:
- heroic operators
- central human framing
- implication of constant human control

Why dangerous:
This misrepresents autonomy and creates false expectations of intervention.

---

## 9. Persistent Alerts

Hazardous patterns include:
- permanent amber states
- repeating alarms without escalation
- alerts that never resolve

Why dangerous:
This creates alarm fatigue and delayed response.

---

## 10. Emotional Atmosphere

Hazardous elements include:
- dramatic lighting
- cinematic composition
- awe-inducing scale exaggeration
- calming or intimidating effects

Why dangerous:
Emotion interferes with judgment.

---

## 11. Composite Hazard Environments

Multiple minor violations may combine into a major hazard.

Even subtle anthropomorphic or decorative cues can accumulate into misinterpretation.

CPAS evaluates the **total perceptual effect**.

---

## 12. Normative Visual Reference

The image located at:

    APPENDICES/IMAGES/NORMATIVE/05_visual_hazards.png

defines common CPAS visual hazard scenarios.

Any configuration substantially similar to those depicted SHALL be considered non-compliant.

---

## Summary

Visual hazards cause humans to forget:

“This is a system operating under constraint.”

If a system appears:
- alive
- expressive
- social
- emotionally engaging

then CPAS has been violated.

Correct systems do not demand attention.  
They allow attention to fade.
