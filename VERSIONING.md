# CPAS Versioning and Governance

This document defines how the Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS) evolves over time.

CPAS is a normative design doctrine.  
Its value depends on semantic stability, controlled change, and clear authority.

---

## 1. Versioning Model

CPAS uses a three-part versioning scheme:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

### MAJOR
Incremented only when:
- the foundational philosophy changes
- perceptual goals are redefined
- compatibility with prior interpretations is intentionally broken

MAJOR changes are rare and explicit.

---

### MINOR
Incremented when:
- scope is expanded
- clarifications are added
- new normative sections are introduced
- new appendices are added that do not alter core meaning

MINOR updates preserve semantic continuity.

---

### PATCH
Incremented when:
- errors are corrected
- language is clarified
- formatting or structure is improved
- references are updated without changing meaning

PATCH updates SHALL NOT alter interpretation.

---

## 2. CPAS v1.0 Definition

**CPAS v1.0** is the foundational release.

It establishes:
- core principles
- explicit prohibitions
- perceptual specifications
- color signaling semantics
- sound signaling semantics
- compliance criteria
- visual hazard identification

CPAS v1.0 intentionally adopts a conservative baseline designed to resist aesthetic drift.

---

## 3. Semantic Stability (Mandatory)

All future versions of CPAS SHALL preserve semantic continuity unless a MAJOR version increment is declared.

No change SHALL:
- silently alter interpretation
- weaken prohibitions
- reintroduce anthropomorphic ambiguity
- redefine core terms without explicit versioning

Semantic integrity takes precedence over flexibility.

---

## 4. Governance

CPAS is governed, not crowd-sourced.

### Contributions
The following MAY be submitted:
- clarification requests
- error reports
- implementation questions
- formally proposed amendments

The following are prohibited:
- casual pull requests altering doctrine
- stylistic edits that change meaning
- reinterpretations labeled as CPAS without approval

---

## 5. Forking Policy

Forks of this repository are permitted under the license, but:

- modified doctrines SHALL be renamed
- the term “CPAS” SHALL NOT be used to describe altered semantics
- attribution to the original CPAS MUST remain intact

Silent mutation of CPAS meaning is prohibited.

---

## 6. Backward Interpretation

Systems claiming CPAS compliance MUST specify the CPAS version they adhere to.

Compliance claims without version reference are invalid.

---

## 7. Authority

Normative authority for CPAS v1.0 resides with the original doctrine as published in this repository.

Future authority transitions, if any, MUST be explicitly declared.

---

## Summary

CPAS evolves slowly and deliberately.

- clarity is prioritized over novelty
- stability is prioritized over flexibility
- meaning is protected over time

If CPAS changes, the change SHALL be obvious.
