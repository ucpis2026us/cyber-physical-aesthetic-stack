# CPAS Perceptual Specifications

This document defines the perceptual requirements that a human observer MUST experience when encountering a CPAS-compliant autonomous cyber-physical system.

These specifications are normative.  
If human perception contradicts these requirements, the system is non-compliant regardless of internal correctness.

---

## 1. Immediate Classification (≤ 3 Seconds)

Within three seconds of initial observation, a reasonable human observer MUST classify the system as infrastructure, not as a living being, agent, or social actor.

### Required Perception
- “This is a system.”
- “This is operating under constraint.”
- “This does not require me.”

### Prohibited Perception
- “It is aware of me.”
- “It is thinking.”
- “It has intent or emotion.”
- “It is a form of life.”

If an observer wonders what the system wants, CPAS has failed.

---

## 2. Environment-First Perception

The system MUST be perceived as an environment or facility before it is perceived as an object.

### Requirements
- Spatial continuity is visually dominant
- No single component is framed as a central character
- Multiple coordinated elements are visible

If a viewer can point to a single object and identify it as “the AI,” the system is non-compliant.

---

## 3. Absence of Gaze and Acknowledgment

The system MUST NOT visually acknowledge the observer.

### Prohibited Indicators
- implied front-facing orientation
- symmetry suggesting a face
- gaze-like alignment
- tracking or orienting toward humans

The observer SHOULD feel irrelevant to system operation.

---

## 4. State Before Motion

Operational state MUST be perceptible before motion draws attention.

### Requirements
- Status indicators visible at rest
- Light and signaling precede or contextualize motion
- Motion never serves as primary attention capture

Motion explains how work occurs; state explains what is occurring.  
State SHALL always be perceptually primary.

---

## 5. Semantic Lighting Only

All lighting MUST encode meaning.

### Requirements
- Neutral illumination for visibility
- Restricted color usage for state signaling
- Consistent color semantics across contexts

Decorative or ambient lighting is prohibited.

If a light does not change system interpretation when removed, it is non-compliant.

---

## 6. Geometry Communicates Constraint

Physical form MUST communicate limitation and capability boundaries.

### Requirements
- Rectilinear or mechanically necessary geometry
- Visible structure and force paths
- Repetition and modularity

Expressive or organic forms that imply intent or personality are prohibited.

---

## 7. Scale Is Informational, Not Emotional

System scale MUST be legible without dramatization.

### Requirements
- Honest representation of size and mass
- Clear relationship to human scale
- No cinematic exaggeration or minimization

Scale SHALL inform understanding, not provoke awe or fear.

---

## 8. Human De-Centering

If humans are present, they MUST be visually subordinate to the system.

### Requirements
- Humans appear as observers, maintainers, or interfaces
- Human presence is peripheral
- Normal operation does not imply human involvement

Hero framing or human-centered action imagery is prohibited.

---

## 9. Silence as Normal Operation

Normal operation MUST be silent.

Sound MAY occur only for safety-critical signaling requiring immediate attention.

If a system produces sound during nominal operation, it is non-compliant.

---

## 10. Time Resistance

The system MUST not appear tied to aesthetic trends or speculative futures.

### Requirements
- Conservative visual vocabulary
- Familiar infrastructural cues
- Absence of fashion-driven styling

If the system appears dated due to stylistic trends, CPAS has been violated.

---

## 11. The Boredom Test (Required)

After sixty seconds of observation:

### Required Outcome
- Attention naturally diminishes
- No emotional engagement persists
- No curiosity about intent or thought

### Failure Indicators
- Desire to continue watching “to see what it does”
- Attribution of intelligence or personality
- Emotional response beyond situational awareness

Boredom is evidence of correct autonomous presentation.

---

## Summary

A CPAS-compliant system is perceived as:
- infrastructure, not life
- operating regardless of observation
- calm, constrained, and indifferent
- legible without explanation
- trustworthy because it is boring

If a system feels alive, CPAS has failed.
