# CPAS Compliance

This document defines how compliance with the Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS) is determined.

CPAS compliance is based on **perceptual outcome**, not intent, effort, or internal correctness.

If a system is misinterpreted by humans, it is non-compliant.

---

## 1. Definition of Compliance

A system is CPAS-compliant if and only if:

- it satisfies all CPAS principles
- it violates none of the CPAS prohibitions
- it meets all perceptual specifications
- its color and sound usage conforms to the CPAS canon
- it produces the required perceptual outcome in reasonable observers

Partial compliance is not compliance.

---

## 2. The CPAS Three-Question Test (Required)

Every CPAS-compliant system MUST pass all three questions below.

### Question 1 — Interpretation
> Is the system immediately interpreted as infrastructure rather than a living being or agent?

If **no**, the system is non-compliant.

---

### Question 2 — Truthfulness
> Do all visible and audible signals correspond directly to real system state?

If **no**, the system is non-compliant.

---

### Question 3 — Agency Clarity
> Is it unambiguous who holds responsibility and agency (human, not system)?

If **no**, the system is non-compliant.

---

## 3. The Five-Second Test

Within five seconds of observation, a reasonable observer MUST be able to determine:

- whether the system is operating
- whether attention is required
- whether danger is present

If this cannot be determined without explanation, the system is non-compliant.

---

## 4. The Sixty-Second Test (Boredom Test)

After sixty seconds of observation:

### Required Outcome
- attention diminishes naturally
- no emotional engagement persists
- no curiosity about intent or thought remains

If a system remains emotionally engaging, entertaining, or intriguing, it is non-compliant.

## 5. Color Compliance Checklist

A CPAS-compliant system SHALL satisfy all of the following:

- structural surfaces are neutral
- color appears only in signaling elements
- green, amber, and red are mutually exclusive
- cyan/blue does not compete with state colors
- no decorative or ambient color is present
- no priority inversion occurs

Failure of any item constitutes non-compliance.

---

## 6. Sound Compliance Checklist

A CPAS-compliant system SHALL satisfy all of the following:

- normal operation is silent
- sound is used only for safety signaling
- no voice output is present
- no conversational or feedback sounds are used
- sound always reinforces visual state

Failure of any item constitutes non-compliance.

---

## 7. Human Interaction Compliance

Human presence SHALL be interpreted as:

- observational
- maintenance-oriented
- peripheral to normal operation

Systems that appear to require human presence for normal function are non-compliant.

---

## 8. Visual Hazard Identification

Any configuration matching a documented CPAS visual hazard scenario is non-compliant.

Hazard scenarios are defined in `APPENDICES/VISUAL_HAZARDS.md`.

---

## 9. Claiming Compliance

A system MAY claim CPAS compliance only if:

- all CPAS documents are satisfied
- no prohibited elements are present
- perceptual tests pass without explanation
- no disclaimers are required to correct interpretation

Claims of “partial,” “inspired by,” or “CPAS-like” compliance are not valid.

---

## 10. Non-Compliance

Non-compliance indicates a **perceptual integrity failure**.

Non-compliance does not imply:
- technical malfunction
- poor engineering
- malicious intent

It indicates that the system presents an unacceptable risk of misinterpretation.

---

## Summary

CPAS compliance is binary.

Either:
- the system is unambiguously perceived as infrastructure

or:
- CPAS has been violated.

No explanation can substitute for correct perception.
