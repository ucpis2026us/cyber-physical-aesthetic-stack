# Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS)

## 1. Definition

The **Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS)** is a normative design doctrine that defines how autonomous cyber-physical systems MUST present themselves visually, spatially, and perceptually to humans.

CPAS governs external appearance, signaling, spatial organization, and perceptual cues in order to ensure that autonomous systems are interpreted as **infrastructure**, not as agents, beings, or forms of life.

CPAS is not an art style, branding system, or user experience framework.  
It is an operational constraint layer.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Autonomous cyber-physical systems increasingly fail not due to computation or control errors, but due to **human misinterpretation**.

When systems appear expressive, conversational, or life-like, humans:
- project intent and agency
- overtrust system outputs
- misassign responsibility
- experience fear or moral confusion
- misunderstand limits and failure modes

These failures occur even when the system functions correctly.

CPAS addresses this class of failure by constraining **how systems are perceived**, not how they compute.

---

## 3. Purpose

The purpose of CPAS is to enforce **perceptual unambiguousness**.

A CPAS-compliant system SHALL:
- be immediately interpreted as a system, not a mind
- communicate operational state without narrative or personality
- avoid cues that imply awareness, intent, or emotion
- remain calm, legible, and boring under normal operation

CPAS treats human perception as part of the system boundary.

---

## 4. Canonical Statement

> **Autonomous systems must communicate truth through calm, legible physicality rather than personality, spectacle, or human resemblance.**

This statement is normative and applies to all CPAS-compliant systems.

---

## 5. Scope of Governance

CPAS governs:
- Visual form and geometry
- Color usage and signaling semantics
- Spatial and architectural presentation
- Human interaction zones
- Perceptual priority and salience
- Auditory signaling (sound)
- First-glance and sustained interpretation

CPAS does not govern:
- Internal algorithms or models
- Control logic or autonomy architecture
- Ethical or policy frameworks
- Branding or marketing outside operational environments

---

## 6. Interpretation Boundary

CPAS explicitly separates:
- **Systems** from **agents**
- **Infrastructure** from **life**
- **Signaling** from **expression**

Any design element that causes a reasonable observer to question whether a system is a form of life, agent, or social actor is non-compliant.

---

## 7. Relationship to Other Standards

CPAS is complementary to technical interoperability and control standards.

In particular:
- CPAS defines perceptual and interpretive constraints
- Other standards may define electrical, mechanical, computational, or network behavior

CPAS does not conflict with such standards; it constrains presentation and interpretation only.

---

## 8. Normative Authority

All requirements defined in CPAS use the following meanings:

- **SHALL / SHALL NOT** — mandatory
- **SHOULD / SHOULD NOT** — strongly recommended
- **MAY** — optional

Violation of CPAS requirements constitutes a perceptual integrity failure, regardless of technical correctness.

## 9. Version

This document defines:

- **Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS) v1.0**
- Foundational release
- Conservative baseline intended to resist aesthetic drift

Future versions SHALL preserve semantic continuity unless explicitly declared otherwise.
