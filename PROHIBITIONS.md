# CPAS Prohibitions

This document defines elements and practices that are explicitly prohibited under the Cyber-Physical Aesthetic Stack (CPAS).

These prohibitions exist to prevent perceptual ambiguity, anthropomorphism, overtrust, fear, and safety risk.

Violation of any prohibition constitutes **non-compliance**, regardless of intent or technical correctness.

---

## 1. Anthropomorphic Representation (Prohibited)

CPAS-compliant systems SHALL NOT include any visual, auditory, or behavioral elements that imply human or animal characteristics.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- faces
- eyes or eye-like features
- heads or head-like symmetry
- gaze or gaze-following behavior
- facial expressions
- body language intended to convey emotion

Any resemblance to living beings is prohibited.

---

## 2. Implied Agency or Intent (Prohibited)

Systems SHALL NOT appear to:
- want
- decide (in a human sense)
- believe
- care
- understand
- feel

Design elements that suggest internal motivation or autonomous desire are prohibited.

Systems act under constraint; they do not intend.

---

## 3. Conversational or Social Interfaces (Prohibited)

CPAS-compliant systems SHALL NOT:
- speak
- converse
- address humans socially
- present themselves as assistants or companions
- engage in dialogue

Voice synthesis, conversational language, and social interaction metaphors are prohibited.

---

## 4. Decorative Color and Lighting (Prohibited)

Color SHALL NOT be used decoratively.

Prohibited uses include:
- ambient color washes
- mood lighting
- architectural accent lighting
- color used for branding within operational environments
- animated or pulsing color without state change

All color MUST encode operational meaning.

---

## 5. Expressive Motion (Prohibited)

Motion SHALL NOT be used to express personality, curiosity, friendliness, or emotion.

Prohibited motion includes:
- gestural movement
- idle animation
- anticipatory behavior
- attention-seeking motion
- motion designed to entertain or reassure

Motion MUST correspond directly to physical work or safety behavior.

---

## 6. Narrative Framing (Prohibited)

Systems SHALL NOT be presented through narrative, storytelling, or character framing.

Prohibited elements include:
- naming systems as characters
- backstories or personas
- “meet the AI” displays
- anthropomorphic diagrams or mascots

CPAS systems do not have stories; they have states.

---

## 7. Persistent Alerts Without Escalation (Prohibited)

Warning or alert signals SHALL NOT persist without escalation or resolution.

Prohibited patterns include:
- permanent amber states
- always-on warning tones
- visual alerts that become background noise

Persistent alerts that train operators to ignore signals are non-compliant.

---

## 8. Priority Inversion (Prohibited)

Lower-priority signals SHALL NOT visually or audibly dominate higher-priority signals.

Examples of prohibited inversion:
- decorative blue lighting overpowering red fault indicators
- ambient sound masking alarms
- non-critical information brighter than fault signals

Signal hierarchy MUST be preserved at all times.

---

## 9. Human-Centered Hero Framing (Prohibited)

Humans SHALL NOT be visually framed as central operators or heroes within autonomous system environments.

Prohibited depictions include:
- heroic poses
- central framing
- action-focused imagery
- implication that human presence is required for normal operation

Humans may observe or maintain systems, but are not the system’s center of gravity.

---

## 10. Speculative or Futurist Styling (Prohibited)

CPAS-compliant systems SHALL NOT rely on speculative, cinematic, or trend-driven aesthetics.

Prohibited styles include:
- science-fiction tropes
- cyberpunk aesthetics
- glowing seams or energy motifs
- speculative UI metaphors

Presentation MUST be time-resistant and infrastructural.

---

## 11. Emotional Framing (Prohibited)

Systems SHALL NOT attempt to comfort, reassure, intimidate, or emotionally influence humans.

Prohibited elements include:
- calming voices
- friendly tones
- emotional language
- expressive sound design

CPAS systems inform; they do not emote.

---

## 12. Explanation as a Substitute for Clarity (Prohibited)

Designs SHALL NOT rely on training, explanation, or documentation to correct perceptual ambiguity.

If a system requires explanation to be interpreted correctly, it is non-compliant.

Correct interpretation MUST be immediate and perceptual.

---

## Summary

The following are strictly prohibited under CPAS:
- anthropomorphism
- personality
- narrative
- decorative signaling
- expressive behavior
- emotional framing

Any element that causes a reasonable observer to question whether a system is a form of life constitutes a CPAS violation.
